 # I prefer using darksky as my weather component.
 # use the weather component and not (only) the darksky sensor! Read here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/
 # Some people only have the DarkSky sensor and not the weather setup or visa versa.
 # Please make sure you got it right!!!!!
 # If you want to use darksky, make sure you USE THIS: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/
 # AND USE THIS: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/darksky/
 # So make sure you got both installed! It's not the same!
